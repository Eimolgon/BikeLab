The bicycle lab completed their second annual bicycle tour! Neville, Bart,
Christoph, Nora, Sietse, Jason, and Yumi bicycled from Delft-Rotterdam to
Nijmegen and back over three days and covered about 250 km. We had a few
interesting bicycles in the fleet. Neville and Sietse road the stoker-steering
tandem, Bart rode the lab bakfiets, and Jason and Yumi rode their Innerlight
tandem. The ride took us along the Waal river and through the beautiful
Gelderland fruit orchards. In Nijmegen, we visited the national bicycle museum,
Velorama_, and walked through the history of the development of the bicycle
with their extensive collection. Following the museum, `Dr. Eric Maris`_ hosted
us and let us try out his bicycle simulator system at Radboud University. We
had great weather for the entire ride and closed the trip with a waterbus trip
from Sliedrecht to Rotterdam.
