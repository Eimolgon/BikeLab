Going downhill
Rightward curve
Large lean angle to the right
Riding a Felt bicycle

Here is a map of the course by Imola: https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/uci-road-world-championships-465806

Women time trialers average about 45 km/h (12.5 m/s), so she must have been
going faster than this going down hill (but she isn't pedaling).

4:09 to 4:10 The seat of the bike bounces up, seemingly a bump in the road
4:10 to 4:19 She bounces once on the seat and then a second time with her butt
disconnecting from the seat. The bicycle leans further rightward during this
process.
4:19 to 4:23 bounces back down on the seat
4:23 to 4:27 bounces back up off the seat, bike is even further leaned hard to
the right
4:27 to 5:02 connects back down to the seat (much harder it seems), bike leans
back to the left just before connecting (but still at hard right roll angle)

hard to detect next left max because the collision with the rail is occurring


Ploch2012 shows wobble frequencies between 6 and 9 Hz for 0 to 20 m/s in Figure
4. Same figure shows the wobble mode unstable from about 4 to 20 m/s. This is
for a model with rider lean and the but attached to the seat.

Klinger2014 shows wobble between 8 and 12 Hz for 0 to 20 m/s for leaned over
hands on handlebars (no rider lean DOF).

Figure 6.10 in my dissertation shows that the weave frequency for a bicycle
without a rider can get higher 10 rad/s (1.6 Hz) at 7 m/s, maybe it would be
close to 4 Hz at 13 m/s?? But weave should be damped and stable at these
speeds.

TODO
====

- Get the grade and curvature of the curve from Google maps or some other
  similar thing?
- What speed was she going?
- Check frequency in this video: https://youtu.be/VfngbsIUSj8
