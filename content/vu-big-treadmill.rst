Today we (Jodi and I) went to the VU University Amsterdam and looked at the big
treadmill from the faculty of Human Movement Sciences. My friend `Knoek van
Soest <http://www.fbw.vu.nl/Epersona/Soest.htm>`__ works there and was so nice
to let us do some preliminary tests to see if we could use the treadmill for
our bicycle handling quality experiments.  The `treadmill
<http://bicycle.tudelft.nl/schwab/Bicycle/TreadmillVU.jpg>`__ is big, 3 by 5 m,
and has maximum speed of 30 km/h. The minister of Education, `Ronald Plasterk
<http://bicycle.tudelft.nl/schwab/Bicycle/demonstratie-0323red.jpg>`__,  on a
work visit at the VU, also showed genuine interest in our experiments!

|    My first run on the treadmill  |    Jodi demonstrates              |
|    `(wmv 2.6 Mb)`_.               |    `(wmv 11.2 Mb)`_               |
|    Low speed because it looked    |    that you can ride at a         |
|    scary, and it turned out to be |    moderate speed in a stable     |
|    rather strange: you move but   |    manner. Next we perturb the    |
|    then you don't. Te problem is  |    bicycle laterally by pulling a |
|    that you are cycling but your  |    string attached to the saddle  |
|    eyes tell you you are          |    post. You see a nice response  |
|    stationary. Of course after    |    when Jodi recovers. Seems to   |
|    some practice it works out     |    work out fine,  although we    |
|    fine. Doing an emergency stop  |    both had problems with the     |
|    is really fun. You just fall   |    visual information (I'm not    |
|    over like an inverted          |    moving but the belt is!) and   |
|    pendulum!                      |    it felt like we had a soft     |
|                                   |    rear tire.                     |
