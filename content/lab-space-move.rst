This month the bicycle lab moved to the new lab space (room `4A-1-04
<http://bicycle.tudelft.nl/schwab/Bicycle/OCP-plattegrond_2009.jpg>`__) which
is on the first floor, close to our offices. We are very happy with the new
lab; more than 80 m\ :sup:`2` of light and clean space with lots of room for
table-top experimental setups and high visibility from the corridor because of
the large glass windows.
