Oliver Lee successfully presented some results on the usage of our static
bicycle simulator at the International Cycle Safety Conference in Hannover,
Germany (`ICSC2015 <http://www.icsc2015.eu/>`__). One of the characteristics of
the Static Bicycle Simulator is haptic feedback on the handlebars driven by the
bicycle simulation model. Another aspect is that it does not roll, therefore we
call it the *static* bicycle simulator. For visual feedback a simple screen
with third person view is used, but a head mounted display (HMD, such as the
`oculus rift <https://www.oculus.com/en-us/rift/>`__) can be used.

Applications for this simulator are: traffic and environmental interaction
simulation and training, balance and maneuver assessment, balance training.
Below is a short youtube video to see the static bicycle simulator in
operation.
