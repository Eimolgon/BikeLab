A group of TU Delft BSc students (Jibbe Knuit, Frans Kok, Philip Raaphorst and
Arne Spek) did a project on measuring vertical stiffness and damping of bicycle
tires. A total of 11 tires were measured at 3 normal loads and 3 internal
pressures. The setup, data and results can be found at this website:
