`Jan 9-11, 2009 <#Jan2009>`__: For three days we have been doing full motion
capture of the rider and the bicycle while riding on the large(3X5 m) VU
Amsterdam treadmil. This to investigate rider motions on a bicycle. The
Optotrack Certus Motion Capture System with active markers was used (thanks to
the VU!) with 31 markers (20 on the rider, 11 on the bicycle) at a sample freq
of 100 Hz. The test comprised: normal pedalling, towing, hands-free pedalling,
pedalling with line tracking. The belt speed (=forward bicycle speed) was
varied from 5 to 30 km/h in steps of 5 km/h and then down in the same manner.
At every speed we measured for 60 seconds. Going down we also tried 5,4,3,2,..
km/h until one could not stabilize any more. Every test was done with three
riders and two bicycles form Batavus, the Browser and a Stratos.
