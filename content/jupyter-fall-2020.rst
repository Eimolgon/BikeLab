Summary
-------
During the fall quarter of 2020, the Jupyter Team made improvements to

JupyterCon 2020
---------------
Jupyter Team attended a JupyterCon sprint to improve 
`Thebe <https://github.com/executablebooks/thebe/>`__, an open source project
which we use to insert executable code blocks into LibreTexts textbook pages.

CKEditor Query Plugin
---------------------
The `CKEditor Query Plugin <https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ 
is a plugin added to the text editor, CKEditor, allowing textbook authors to
add interactive problems to the HTML pages. It does so by embedding 
HTML and Javascript into the page.

Cluster Migration
-----------------
During the winter break, the Jupyter team migrated the previous Flock cluster 
to the new Galaxy cluster. This involved various changes in networking,
hardware, and Jupyterhub.
