:summary: Georgios Dialynas will defend his Bicycle Lab PhD thesis September 15
          at 12:30 CEST.

From Georgios:

   I will be defending my Ph.D. dissertation titled "An experimental approach
   into the quantification of steering and balance behaviour of bicyclists" on
   Tuesday 15th September 2020 at 12.30-13:30 h in the Senaatszaal of the TU
   Delft Aula. Prior to the defense, at  12.00 h, I will give a brief
   presentation about my research. I invite my family and friends to join the
   event via: https://www.facebook.com/events/1012404512534541 (I decided FB
   since there are no time or participants limitations for the mobile version)

   Thesis Aim

   The aim of this thesis is to derive bicycle rider control models, based on
   experimental data, that mimic the rider in his balance control task at
   various forward speeds. These rider control models can help to understand
   bicycle falls and crashes, predict cyclist motions necessary for vehicle to
   vehicle safety systems, and can guide towards the design of a bicycle with
   active balance control. You can find the softcopy of my thesis here:

   Kind Regards,
