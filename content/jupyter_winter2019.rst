1.0 Background
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As part of the `$5M grant`_ awarded to the LibreTexts project last year,
our team was created with two goals: to integrate Jupyter into the LibreTexts
website and to create a computing cluster running JupyterHub to serve UC Davis.
This quarter, we focused on researching how to create the cluster through building test servers.
