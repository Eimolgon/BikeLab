The TU Delft Bicycle Lab is a research lab in the `Biomechatronics &
Human-Machine Control Group`_ of the `BioMechanical Engineering Department`_ at
`Delft University of Technology`_ led by `Jason K. Moore`_. Our research is
centered around the science and engineering of bicycles and spans the following
themes:

- single track vehicle dynamics, handling, and control
- improving design of bicycles and other human powered vehicles
- enhancing athlete performance and safety in sports (cycling & more)
- bicycle and micromobility transportation improvements and safety
- human powered appropriate technology
- engineering and scientific software design and development
- teaching and learning in engineering education

The TU Delft lab started in the mid 2000's at TU Delft under the direction of
`Arend L. Schwab`_. Dr. Schwab retired in 2021 and Jason K. Moore took over the
lab and research program. In Delft, Dr. Moore merged his University of
California, Davis based research program with TU Delft's, defining what exists
today.
