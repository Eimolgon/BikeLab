The Bicycle Laboratorium is a research lab in the `Biomechantronics and
Human-Machine Control Group`_ of the `BioMechanical Engineering Department`_ at
`Delft University of Technology`_ led by `Arend L.  Schwab`_ and `Jason K.
Moore`_. Our research is centered around the science and engineering of
bicycles and spans the following themes:

- design of bicycles and other human powered vehicles
- single track vehicle dynamics, handling, and control
- enhancing athlete performance and safety in sports of cycling
- bicycle and micromobility transportation improvements and safety
- human powered appropriate technology
- engineering and scientific software design and development
- teaching and learning in engineering education
