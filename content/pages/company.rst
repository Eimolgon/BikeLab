Internship
==========

3mE students are required to do an internship worth 15 ECs (~400 hours, 10
weeks full time) as part of the MSc program. The students should be tasked with
engineering work that ideally aligns with their MSc track, supervised by a
company representative, and integrated into the company/organization for
experience working with others in a professional setting. The student cannot be
employed by the company/organization but may be offered a student stipend. A TU
Delft supervisor approves the internship and associated project and assesses a
student written report at the end of the internship for a pass/fail grade for
the 15 ECs. The report will be read and stored by the TU Delft supervisor(s)
but may stay confidential otherwise.

The sponsoring company/organization and student should arrange any agreements
between themselves for intellectual property rights and/or non-disclosure
associated with the student's work.

Literature Study + MSc Thesis Project
=====================================

3mE students are required to do a literature study worth 10 ECs (~270 hours, 7
weeks) and an MSc thesis project worth 35 ECs (~945 hours, 24 weeks). These two
things are typically and ideally aligned on the same topic. This research
oriented engineering work should be driven by the student.

Internships

3mE students must do a 15 EC internship at a company or organization. TU Delft staff is not involved in the internship work. The company can arrange agreements with the intern regarding intellectual property rights or non-disclosure. The project description and final report is read by the TUD Supervisor for assessment purposes but may remain confidential otherwise.

Students are provided this guidance on making their agreements with the company:

Literate Study + MSc Thesis Project

3mE students must do a literature study (10 ECs) and an MSc project (35 Ecs). Company sponsored MSc research do involve TU Delft staff and their intellectual contribution to the outcomes of the project. Resulting theses are read by TU Delft staff and must eventually be shared publicly. Students must arrange an agreement with the company that is approved by 3mE. The form for that is here:

Companies may also want to or need to establish an agreement with TU Delft for the staff's contribution that goes beyond the above student initiated agreement. These are made on a case-by-case basis. Guidelines and TU Delft's base stance are provided in this document:
