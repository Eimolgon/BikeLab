Common Issues
=============

Creating figures
----------------

Students often create figures that are saved from figure creation software
without any adjustements to the default settings. The default settings are
never appropriate.

Look up how to make publication quality figures with your preferred software.

Python

Matlab

Font sizes too small.

When to use a figure
--------------------

If you refer to a figure in the text, that figure should be nearby the text so
that the reader can read your interpretation of the figure while looking at it.

All figures should be referenced and discussed in the text, i.e. don't just
throw in a figure because you made and it looks nice.

Only insert a figure when it enhances the story you are telling in the text.

Figure and Table Captions
-------------------------

Figures and tables and their associated captions should be able to be removed
from the text and a reader should still be able to "read" the figure or table.
This means that the caption should help the reader know how to read the figure.
Anything that isn't obvious from teh figure's design should be include, e.g.
"The solid black lines represent the real part of the eigenvalue loci for the
fifth eigenmode." The caption should not include discussion or interpretation
of the figure, that belongs in your primary text.

Copyright
---------

In general, you cannot include figures you did not create draw yourself in your
document. If you want to include the figure there are essentially three
options:

1. Ask the copyright holder for written permission to use their figure.
2. If the copyright holder has licensed their figure with a Creative Commons
   license (or similar) then you can use the figure if you abide by the
   license's rules.
3. It may be possible to use the figure without permission if the use falls
   under an exception in your jurisdiction. Dutch Law seems to have exceptions
   for "Illustration for teaching or scientific research", "Quotation for
   criticism or review", and "Use for the purpose of research or private
   study". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_Netherlands

Math
----

Do not use :math:`a*b` or :math:`a\times b` to indicate scalar multiplication,
:math:`ab` is clear and more than sufficient.

LaTeX
-----

This is how you do quotes in LaTeX!

::

   `single quoted stuff`
   ``double quoted stuff''

Style
