Master's Students
=================

Anyone may apply to the Master's Program at TU Delft if you have completed an
appropriate Bachelor's degree. If you want to work directly in this lab you
need to apply to the `Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering`_ and
preferrably select the `BioMechanical Design Track`_.

If you would like to work on a project for your Master's thesis in the lab
please send a letter explaining your interest in the lab, CV or resume, and any
other relevant information to j.k.moore@tudelft.nl. Include whether you have
been accepted to the University or have not applied yet.

If you'd like to see what some of the possibilities for projects are, browse
the `current and past research projects <{filename}/pages/research/index.rst>`_
on this website and I also post non-confidential project ideas to this Github
repository:

https://github.com/mechmotum/ideas/issues

I will provide any confidential projects available in personal discussion with
you. If any of these projects interest you or you have a project idea that is
similar, be sure to let me know in your introduction email.

Bachelor's Students
===================

Students working towards their Bachelor's degree are welcome to join the lab to
get research and engineering experience. Bachelor's students will start with a
one month trial period. Please send a letter explaining your interest in the
lab, CV or resume, and any other relevant information to j.k.moore@tudelft.nl.
