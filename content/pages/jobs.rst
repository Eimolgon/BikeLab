Researchers, Postdoctoral Researchers, PhD Researchers
======================================================

If you are interested in doing paid research with the lab after you have
obtained a related Master's degree [#]_ there are two options:

1. Wait for an open position in the lab and apply.
2. Find self-funding and ask if we can host and work with you.

All paid positions associated with the lab will be posted to the `TU Delft
vacancies website`_, the `BioMechanical Engineering Department vacancies web
page`_, `Academic Transfer`_ [#]_, and/or this lab website.

Master's Students
=================

Anyone may apply to the Master's Program at TU Delft if you have completed an
appropriate Bachelor's degree. If you want to work directly in this lab it is
best to apply to the `Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering`_ and
preferably select the `BioMechanical Design Track`_. `This video`_ explains the
MSc tracks in the BME department.
