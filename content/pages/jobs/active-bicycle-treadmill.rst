   treadmill for walking, running, and other human motion. We intended to
   design something similar for low speed single track vehicles.

Description
===========

The bicycle lab is interested in developing an actuated treadmill for slow
speed single track vehicle (bicycles, scooters, mopeds, motorcycles, etc.)
balance and control experiments. To allow for maneuvers where a change in
heading occur and measurement of ground reaction forces at each tire contact
patch active control of a moving base treadmill is required. The desired system
should have these features:

- dual, tandem forces plates under the treadmill belts capable of accurate
  lateral, longitudinal, and normal forces at each tire contact patch
- real time heading of the vehicle is accurately measured for use in a heading
  tracking controller
- the treadmill itself can yaw relative the fixed ground atop an actuated turn
  table
- a heading tracking controller that commands the treadmill's yaw angle to
  match that of the rider to an adequate bandwidth and amplitude for typical
  navigational heading changes
- (optionally) the ability to pitch the treadmill for longitudinal
  stabilization and/or for mimicking grade changes of terrain

The student will be responsible for ensuring that the heading dynamics are
realistic (for limited heading maneuvers) for the bicycle rider. This will
likely require limiting yaw accelerations and designing washout algorithms due
to any machine limitations and mismatches with the actual dynamics of an on
road experience.

How to Apply
============

Send an email to j.k.moore@tudelft.nl with the title of the project in the
subject line. Include an approximately half-page motivation letter explaining
why you want to work in the Bicycle Lab on this project, what relevant skills
you have, and your current resume or C.V.
