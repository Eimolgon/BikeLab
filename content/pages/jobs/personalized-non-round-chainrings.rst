   The TrueBike, a cycling trainer that mimics the forces felt when
   accelerating, grade changes, and wind drag.

**Overall objective**: Personalized non-round chainrings based on real-time
optimization of the shape of a (virtual) chainring

**Research options**:

- Collect, review, discuss available research of non-round chainrings
- Establish a penalty function that would have to be minimized during the
  optimization.  Penalty function can be related to muscle activation, speed
  variations, multibody analysis, etc
- Develop an optimization algorithm that modifies the chainrings whilst cycling
- Develop a measurement protocol to find the optimal chainring for an
  individual. The form of the chainring will influence fatigue and muscle
  contraction speed, leading to new optimal chainrings
