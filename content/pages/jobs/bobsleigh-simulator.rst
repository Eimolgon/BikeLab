`The Jamaican Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation`_ is interested in having a modern
low-cost bobsled simulator that can be used for training athletes in Jamaica as
well as a recruiting device for introducing newcomers to the sport. Bobsleigh
tracks are few and far between and mostly only exist at past and future winter
Olympic sites. The tracks are only available for limited practice use
leading up to the Olympics. Due to the expense of the sleighs and the tracks,
this makes it difficult for many countries to support teams. The `Jamaican
National Bobsleigh Team`_ has a
unique history, being one of the only tropical countries that has fielded teams
for these winter sports.

The goal of this project would be to design a bobsleigh simulator that provides
a fully immersive and realistic experience, including relevant motion sensation
to the rider(s), virtual reality, and proper steering actuation. Multiple
tracks, including customized designs, should be supported by the simulator. The
dynamics of the simulator should mimic that of the real system and washout
techniques developed to support a large set of motions. The design should be
simple and small in size for reduced cost and portability.

Students taking on this project will likely work with students at The
University of Technology, Jamaica and industrial partners to realize a
prototype of the simulator.
