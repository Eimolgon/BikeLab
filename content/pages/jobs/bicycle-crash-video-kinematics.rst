   Pose estimation example using OpenPose.

It is extremely difficult to obtain motion data of bicycle crashes for a number
of reasons. But this kind of data would be very useful in understanding why
falls and crashes occur during bicycling.  Understanding the mechanisms are key
to preventing injuries and death of bicyclists. It is a bit easier to find and
collect video data of crashes and there are a number of new technologies that
make it easier to extract kinematic motion and pose data from videos using
machine learning (e.g. DeepLabCut_, OpenPose_).  The TU Delft Bicycle lab has a
reasonably large set of training data of typical (non-crash) bicycling that can
be used to build the video to kinematics predictive models. The goal of this
project would be to collect a large set of bicycle crash videos, build a model
that can extract the kinematics of both the bicycle and the rider, and show
that accurate kinematics can be acquired.
