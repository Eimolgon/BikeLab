Prior research has shown that tracking performance can be improved in a
human-in-the-loop control task by inserting a robot in between the human and
the environment and utilizing Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a short even
horizon to assist control. The MPC controller was found to be favored by the
person performing the task to more typically used controllers such as PID. The
goal of this project is to extend this idea to the more complex task of making
lane changes on a bicycle.  The student's job will be to develop an MPC based
assistive control algorithm for the TU Delft Steer-by-Wire bicycle (shown
above) and test the performance of the controller through a series of treadmill
based lane change tasks.

How to Apply
============

Send an email to j.k.moore@tudelft.nl with the title of the project in the
subject line. Include an approximately half-page motivation letter explaining
why you want to work in the Bicycle Lab on this project, what relevant skills
you have, and your current resume or C.V.
