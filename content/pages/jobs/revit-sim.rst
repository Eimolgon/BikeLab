Crashing during motorcycling, in sport or recreation, is highly likely to cause
injury. Advanced safety equipment can reduce injury and prevent death in the
event of a crash. Currently `REV'IT!`_ is developing motorcyclist Personal
Protective Equipment (PPE) in the form of an electronically triggered airbag
worn by a rider.  REV'IT! has a seat at the European body for standardization
for motocyclist PPE (CEN/TC162/WG9) as well as the ad-hoc group 'Airbags'. The
body is aiming to develop an EN standard for electronically triggered Airbags.

Such airbags can be broken down into various components: the inflatable, the
canisters, the garment, the hardware (electronics), and the software. At this
moment in time REV'IT! is / has been focusing on the bladder, garment,
canisters and hardware, and although REV'IT! has been logging rider data in the
MotoGP for a couple of years, it is lacking reliable crash data from
non-extreme sports in order to develop an algorithm for crash detection that is
able to detect and react to an evolving accident. Collecting reliable crash
data highly depends on the amount of crashes recorded, the environmental
influences, the sort of accident, etc.

In order to accelerate on the amount of crash data, REV'IT! and TUD would like
to investigate if computer simulated accident scenarios can provide the
necessary data to (initially) base an algorithm upon. Currently multi-body
simulation software such as MADYMO is widely used for accident reconstruction
and simulation.

The student will:

- Research setup (possible and common crash scenario's â€“ e.g. analysis results
  from European research projects RIDERSCAN, PIONEERS)
- Determine, reconstruct and simulate crash scenarios
- Collect crash data and compare between simuluation and MotoGP logged data
- Benchmark simulated crash data to real-life and/or conditioned crashes
  (=crash tests)
