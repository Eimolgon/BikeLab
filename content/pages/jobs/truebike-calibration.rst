   The TrueBike, a cycling trainer that mimics the forces felt when
   accelerating, grade changes, and wind drag.

**Overall objective**: Establish the power measurement accuracy of the TrueBike
and develop a develop an efficient power calibration methodology.

**Research options**:

- Review method and accuracy measured by TrueKinetix
- Set-up a calibration method to prove the accuracy
- Develop a calibration method/tool to calibrate the Power meter of a TrueBike
