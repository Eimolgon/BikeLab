:title: Guide

This page is intended to house documentation for lab members that describes the
nuts and bolts of how the lab functions. It's primary purpose is for
on-boarding new members, but is also a reference for current members. For this
page to be useful, all lab members will need to provide their collective
knowledge and experiences. It is up to all of us to make this guide useful. You
are expected to contribute to the guide and edit it. Discuss with the lab any
desires to change any of the guidelines.

Open Science
============

The default science and engineering practice should be open practices (open
access publications, open source software, open data, accessible and public
sharing etc.). If unsure whether to make information public, ask, otherwise
please default to sharing early and often. We do work with organizations that
value or require privacy (human subject data, student protected data,
proprietary company needs). Always check with the involved parties before
sharing when this is the case. This is something that should be discussed at
the beginning of all projects.

Research Tools Contributions
============================

Researcher have to use and develop a variety of tools to complete their work.
For example, we will develop experimental equipment and software often in the
lab. Many tools are potentially useful to other people inside and outside of
the lab. Lab members should build on and contribute to the tools we use and
develop in the lab. There is a general expectation to create and contribute to
open source software and open hardware efforts while working in the lab.

AIO Weekly Emails
=================

Lab members are expected to send out AIOs to the lab group email list and any
project collaborators each week.

"AIO" stands for Accomplishments, Issues, and Objectives. This email should
contain three bullet lists:

- what you or your team accomplished in the previous week,
- what issues you encountered during that week and would like help with, and finally
- what your objectives are for the coming week.

You should send it to mechmotum@googlegroups.com and cc anyone not in the lab
that is involved in your project.

The purpose of these are to share what you are doing with me, anyone involved
in your project outside the lab, and also to share among the lab members. The
latter is the most important one, because many of you may be solving similar
problems and can offer help/tips to other members. Doing this will hopefully
certainly start conversations among the group. Some notes:

- If you are working in a team you can send out a single AIO for your team.
- No need to list your hours worked or who did what in teams.
- The AIOs do not need to be elaborate, concise is best.
- It is ok, and preferred, to reply-all if you want to comment on an AIO with a
  suggestion so everyone can learn.
- The AIOs are not a contest. I am not collecting these to judge how much you
  accomplish, but I do care that you are working, attempting to make progress,
  and communicating with your lab members for help. If you had vacation that
  week or just didn't have much time to work, that's fine, just note that.
- If you need help via with issues, you need to provide enough detail for the
  reader to understand the problem.

The AIOs should be sent the day of your meeting with the PI. It can be before
(we can use it as an agenda) or after if you prefer to work on the issues with
me and then post outstanding ones and the revised objectives post meeting. Some
students like to leave the objectives blank and add them after meeting with the
PI. However you do it, each week the accomplishments should hopefully reflect
the objectives you wrote the previous week.

Quarterly Blog Posts
====================

In general, I would like each project to co-write an end of quarter blog post
on the lab website describing their accomplishments and results. This writing
exercise will help build the content for future papers and theses.

Lab Email List
==============

When you join the lab you should request access to the lab email list:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mechmotum

This is both an announcement list and a discussion list for the lab. All lab
members need to join and pay attention to this list.

Reference Management
====================

The lab has a shared Zotero_ group which can be used for lab related reference
management (currently 20 GB plan). Zotero is an open source reference
management system backed by a consortium of libraries. Create an account and
request membership to the `mechmotum group`_. Note that all lab members can
view the contents of this library.

.. _mechmotum group: https://www.zotero.org/groups/966974/mechmotum

Version Control
===============

The currently has group accounts on Gitlab and Github for version control of
text based sources (software, text, etc):

- https://gitlab.com/mechmotum
- https://github.com/mechmotum

The services are more or less interchangeable. The primary reason to use Gitlab
is if you need a private repository, as it offers those for free. You may
prefer the features of one service over the other.

Lab members should be able to make use of version control and communication
through these services. The Software Carpentry `Git lesson`_ is a recommended
introduction. Create an account on one or both services and request group
membership.

Lab Website
===========

The lab website is a Pelican_ based static website hosted through Github pages.
The source for the website is here:

https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io

Lab members should help collectively maintain and update the website. Please
use the Github pull request mechanism to submit changes for review. As long as
one lab member reviews the pull request and approves the changes, the changes
can be merged.

Research Ideas
==============

Check out our research ideas Github repository to read, post, and discuss new
ideas:

Lab Inventory
=============

There is a common spreadsheet on google drive that lab members should use to
track our non-consumable inventory (tools, devices, expensive stuff,
computers, 3D printing spools in the EDSC, etc). Anytime you buy something add
it to the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet can be accessed at this link:
