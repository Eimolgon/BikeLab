:title: Guide
:sortorder: 5

.. contents::

This page is intended to house documentation for lab members that describes the
nuts and bolts of how the lab functions. It's primary purpose is for
on-boarding new members, but is also a reference for current members. For this
page to be useful, all lab members will need to provide their collective
knowledge and experiences. It is up to all of us to make this guide useful. You
are expected to contribute to the guide and edit it. Discuss with the lab any
desires to change any of the guidelines.

Getting Started
===============

- Join the lab communication channels:

  - Ask Jason <j.k.moore@tudelft.nl> or Marco <M.M.Reijne@tudelft.nl> to add
    you to the lab `email list`_.
  - Ask Rado <r.r.dukalski@tudelft.nl> to add you to the lab's chat room.

- Send an introduction email to the lab email list: who you are, what you will
  work on, etc.
- Add your name and portrait to the `lab members page`_ by sending a PNG or JPG
  300px x 400px portrait to Jason or by submitting a pull request on Github.
- Setup regular mentorship meetings with your mentor(s). This should at least
  be a weekly or biweekly depending on your needs and the mentor(s)
  recommendations.
- Attend biweekly `lab meetings <#laboratory-meetings>`_. Ask a
  lab member for the calendar invite with the video chat link. Add your ideas
  and votes for meeting topics to the google document (ask Marco for
  permissions to edit).
- Send out an AIO (see below) before your regular mentor meetings.
- Get campus card access to the bicycle lab and bicycle lab storage (if
  needed). These can be requested from Arend or Jason. Ask for a tour of the
  space from a current lab member before you start working there.
- If your project is with a company or institution and/or requires transfer of
  sensitive information you will need to arrange the "Graduation Agreement at a
  Company" that abides by the TUD Graduation Conditions. You can find the forms
  here here:
  https://www.tudelft.nl/studenten/faculteiten/3me-studentenportal/onderwijs/gerelateerd/formulieren/msc-formulieren/.
  Discuss this with your supervisor(s) before you start.
- See the `recommended reading list <#recommended-reading>`_ below for some
  reading materials to get you started.

COVID-Time Lab Rules
====================

Use of the bicycle lab for hands-on project work is allowed as long as 3mE
allows this type of work inside the building. Check with Arend or Jason for the
up-to-date rules if in question. The current lab rules are:

- All the `University rules
  <https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2021/tu-delft/coronavirus/>`_ and `3mE rules
  <https://www.tudelft.nl/en/3me/current/information-coronavirus/>`_ apply and
  the following rules are in addition to those.
- Indicate on the lab `reservation calendar`_ when you will be present and how
  many people will be present with your reservation. The reservations work on
  first come, first serve basis. Talk to your fellow lab members if adjustments
  are needed for time conflicts.
- No more than 4 people may be in the lab at any given time.
- 1.5 m distance must be kept between everyone present in the lab.
- Wear masks when up and about in the lab. When seated you may remove your
  mask.
- If you are sick, stay home and get tested.
- Take the virus seriously and respect everyone's health needs/wishes. Everyone
  should feel comfortable if using the space. Communication is key for this.

.. _reservation calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=amcwaG9nMnZxaWRxMXI0dGdmdmlzcWEwazhAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ

Communication
=============

Lab Email List
   When you join the lab you should request access to the lab email list:

   https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mechmotum

   This can both be used by everyone as both an announcement list and a
   discussion list. All lab members need to join and pay attention to this list
   for announcements and are welcome to use if for discussion.
Text, Audio, Video Chat Room
   We host a matrix_ server which can be accessed using https://element.io or
   any other supported clients_. This is used for quick chats, meetings, etc.
   We'll keep the chat histories around, but its best to treat the data as
   transient. Lab members can use as needed for lab related communication.
Issue Trackers
   We make heavy use of issue trackers on Github and Gitlab to communication.
   This is good for topic oriented, long form discussion that needs permanency,
   organization, and/or task control. General lab issues can be tracked in this
   repository (in addition to the website issues):

   https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io

Quarterly Blog Posts
   In general, we would like each project to write regular blog posts for the
   lab website. These posts should describe updates on project progress and
   results. This writing exercise will help build the content for future papers
   and theses and provide outreach to the public about our work. It is helpful
   to do these on a schedule (quarterly, semi-annually, etc.) so that the get
   done. If your project is of a proprietary nature, you'll need to select
   aspects of the project or work that can be shared. Discuss these things with
   your supervisor.

.. _matrix: https://matrix.org/
.. _clients: https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now/

AIO Weekly Emails
-----------------

Lab members are expected to send out AIOs to the lab group email list and any
project collaborators each week.

"AIO" stands for Accomplishments, Issues, and Objectives. This email should
contain three bullet lists:

- what you or your team accomplished in the previous week,
- what issues you encountered during that week and would like help with, and finally
- what your objectives are for the coming week.

You should send it to mechmotum@googlegroups.com and cc anyone not in the lab
that is involved in your project.

The purpose of these are to share what you are doing with your daily
supervisor, anyone involved in your project outside the lab, and also to share
among the lab members. The latter is important, because many of you may be
solving similar problems and can offer help/tips to other members Doing this
will hopefully certainly start conversations among the group. Some notes:

- If you are working in a team you can send out a single AIO for your team.
- No need to list your hours worked or who did what in teams.
- The AIOs do not need to be elaborate, concise is best.
- It is ok, and preferred, to reply-all if you want to comment on an AIO with a
  suggestion so everyone can learn.
- The AIOs are not a contest. Your supervisor is not collecting these to judge
  how much you accomplish, but they do care that you are working, attempting to
  make progress, and communicating with your lab members for help. If you had
  vacation that week or just didn't have much time to work, that's fine, just
  note that.
- If you need help via with issues, you need to provide enough detail for the
  reader to understand the problem.

The AIOs should be sent the day of your meeting with the PI. It can be before
(we can use it as an agenda) or after if you prefer to work on the issues with
me and then post outstanding ones and the revised objectives post meeting. Some
students like to leave the objectives blank and add them after meeting with the
PI. However you do it, each week the accomplishments should hopefully reflect
the objectives you wrote the previous week.

Laboratory Meetings
===================

We meet every two weeks as a lab. Members are expected to attend and
participate regularly. It's fine to miss a meeting here and there, but avoid
making that regular. If the meetings are not useful to you, please be proactive
about helping us make them useful for all.

Research Ideas
==============

Specific MSc project advertisements can be found on the `jobs
<{filename}/pages/jobs.rst>`_.

Check out our research ideas Github repository to read, post, and discuss new
ideas:

https://github.com/mechmotum/ideas/issues

Have a look at current and past projects on the `research page
<{filename}/pages/research/index.rst>`_


Open Science
============

The default science and engineering practice should be open practices (open
access publications, open source software, open data, accessible and public
sharing etc.). If unsure whether to make information public, ask, otherwise
please default to sharing early and often. We do work with organizations that
value or require privacy (human subject data, student protected data,
proprietary company needs). Always check with the involved parties before
sharing when this is the case. This is something that should be discussed at
the beginning of all projects.

TU Delft offers several resources for open science:

- `TU Delft Library Open Science <https://www.tudelft.nl/library/actuele-themas/tu-delft-open-science/>`_
- `Open Access Publishing Information <https://www.tudelft.nl/library/actuele-themas/tu-delft-open-science/os/open-publishing/>`_
- `TU Delft 2020-2024 Open Science Strategic Plan <https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:f2faff07-408f-4cec-bd87-0919c9e4c26f>`_
- `You Share, We Take Care! <https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/current-topics/libraryfor-researchers/library-for-researchers/publishing-outreach/you-share-we-take-care/>`_
- `Open Science Community Delft <https://osc-delft.github.io/>`_

Research Tools Contributions
----------------------------

Researcher have to use and develop a variety of tools to complete their work.
For example, we will develop experimental equipment and software often in the
lab. Many tools are potentially useful to other people inside and outside of
the lab. Lab members should build on and contribute to the tools we use and
develop in the lab. There is a general expectation to create and contribute to
open source software and open hardware efforts while working in the lab.

Lab Website
===========

The lab website is a Pelican_ based static website hosted through Github pages.
The source for the website is here:

https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io

Lab members should help collectively maintain and update the website. Please
use the Github pull request mechanism to submit changes for review. As long as
one lab member reviews the pull request and approves the changes, the changes
can be merged. Keep in mind that content here should reflect the whole of the
lab.

.. _Pelican: getpelican.com

Software Tools
==============

Reference Management
--------------------

The lab has a shared Zotero_ group which can be used for lab related reference
management (currently 20 GB plan). Zotero is an open source reference
management system backed by a consortium of libraries. Create an account and
request membership to the `mechmotum group`_. Note that all lab members can
view the contents of this library.

.. _Zotero: https://www.zotero.org
.. _mechmotum group: https://www.zotero.org/groups/966974/mechmotum

Version Control
---------------

The lab currently has group accounts on Gitlab and Github for version control
of text based sources (software, text, etc):

- https://gitlab.com/mechmotum
- https://github.com/mechmotum

The services are more or less interchangeable. We used Gitlab in the past
because it provided free unrestricted private repositories, but Github does now
too. Gitlab's core software is open source. You may prefer the features of one
service over the other.

Lab members should be able to make use of version control and communication
through these services. The Software Carpentry `Git lesson`_ is a recommended
introduction. Create an account on one or both services and request group
membership.

**Private repositories** are private for a reason. If you gain access to
private repositories in the two organizations you are expected to keep the
private and not to distribute the files in any way. Ask your supervisors if
you'd like to share something that is set to private.

.. _Git lesson: http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/

Lab Space
=========

Inventory
---------

There is a common spreadsheet on google drive that lab members should use to
track our non-consumable inventory (tools, devices, expensive stuff,
computers, 3D printing spools in the EDSC, etc). Anytime you buy something add
it to the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet can be accessed at this link:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w80SolpcLTbLtuFDIf9-F-sS_pO-1PEHSpSgEGH_SSg/edit?usp=sharing

Ask Jason if you don't have permissions for this file.

Training
========

It is important to both learn the tools, methods, and techniques used in the
lab and to teach the lab new things you've learned so we can collaborate
efficiently and effectively.

Useful TU Delft MSc Courses
---------------------------

- Multibody Dynamics B
- Special Topics Course in Sports Engineering: TU Delft organizes an annual two
  week course to train students in sports engineering. Cycling has been used as
  the motivating topic to learn the methods.

The Carpentries Trainings
-------------------------

Each lab member will need to learn the collaborative software tools and open
source development practices needed to work on code and other text based
sources together. Carpentries trainings (Software Carpentry in particular) is a
great way to get started on this. TU Delft offers regular courses:

- `Software Carpentry Workshops
  <https://www.tudelft.nl/library/actuele-themas/research-data-management/r/training-evenementen/training-voor-onderzoekers/software-carpentry-workshop/>`_

Sign up by emailing Femke van Giessen (F.vanGiessen@tudelft.nl) to register for
a slot. You will be directed to an Evenbrite. Sign up on Eventbrite immediately
because these typically fill up in 10 minutes and there are large wait lists.

- TU Delft Data Champions hosts events and trainings:
