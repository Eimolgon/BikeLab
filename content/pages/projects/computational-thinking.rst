:summary-sentence: Programming is not just a way of translating well understood
                   ideas into code; it is a tool for communicating, teaching,
                   learning, and thinking. Students with basic programming
                   skills can use coding as a "pedagogic lever" to learn other
                   topics in engineering, math, natural and social science,
                   arts and humanities.

We have been exploring ways to use computation in the STEM curriculum not
simply as a companion to traditional STEM teaching but as a primary mechanism
for learning. We have given a series of workshops where we present
computational thinking and learning examples from Olin, UC Davis, and other
colleges and develop new methods with the help of the participants.
