:summary-sentence: Mechanical and civil engineers utilize two- and
                   three-dimensional theories of stress and strain to determine
                   if structural beams will fail. Simple mathematical models
                   can be used to make accurate predictions of failure due to
                   shear, bending, and torsion stresses and due to deflection.
                   Solving beam related problems typically involves integrating
                   discontinuous functions and solving for boundary conditions.
                   The integral calculus and algebra details often hide the
                   trees for the woods. This project is centered around
                   developing a package for SymPy that can be used to model and
                   solve analytical beam problems, without getting bogged down
                   in the mathematical details.
