:title: Learning Mechanical Vibrations Through Computational Thinking
:date: 2017
:status: hidden
:summary-sentence: "Computational thinking" is an alternative learning process
                   for formulating and solving engineering problems. A unique
                   set of abstractions are available to the learner in addition
                   to those from mathematical and written language. We have
                   developed an interactive textbook and problem sets using the
                   Jupyter system of tools for 40 hours of in-class teaching
                   and learning. These teaching materials are backed by a
                   custom software library for mechanical vibrations designed
                   to facilitate solving problems with computational thinking.
