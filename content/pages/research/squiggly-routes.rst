:summary-sentence: We have developed a simulation model that predicts travel
                   time and energy costs for a bicyclist traveling over an
                   arbitrary route accounting for elevation changes, bicycle
                   type, rider physiology, traffic signals, and yielding.

   Direct and squiggly routes have time and energy costs for bicyclists.

Description
===========

Bicyclists choose routes at least partially based on the travel time and the
energy required to traverse the route [Winters2010]_. Grade changes, wind, stop
signs, traffic signal timing, rough pavement, undulations, etc. all contribute
to the time and energy costs [Broach2012]_. Urban planners and civil engineers
design infrastructure and routes for bicyclists that have specific time and
energy costs associated with them. In fact, automobile routes and
infrastructure often have more preferable time and energy costs than the
parallel bicycle routes and infrastructure. These bicycle routes are quite
squiggly and are not optimizing the convenience of the bicyclists over the
automobile drive. Using simple physics-based simulations, existing and future
routes and infrastructure designs can be evaluated for time and energy costs.
This puts a clear quantitative numbers to important aspects of the convenience
of bicycling.
