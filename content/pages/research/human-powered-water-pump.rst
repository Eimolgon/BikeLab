:title: Efficiency and Use of Human Powered Irrigation Pumps
:status: hidden
:date: 2017
:summary-sentence: We have developed a inexpensive centrifugal pump that
                   attaches to a simple power takeoff on a Buffalo Bike. Our
                   hypothesis is that a less efficient centrifugal pump paired
                   with power generation from cycling will be overall more
                   efficient than a more efficient positive displacement pump
                   paired with stepping power generation. We have recently
                   shown this to be true by accurately measuring the input
                   biomechanical power and output hydraulic power from both
                   systems to produce efficiency curves as a function of
                   hydraulic load.
