Yesterday, we posted a new preprint to engrXiv_:

   J. K. Moore, B. Cloud, M. Hubbard, and C. A. Brown, "Analysis and Ethical
   Design of Terrain Park Jumps for Snow Sports," Preprint, Mar. 2021.
   [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.31224/osf.io/sq7u9.

The abstract reads:

   Most American snowsport resorts now have terrain parks and decades-long
   epidemiological evidence correlates terrain park use with injuries.
   Engineering design of jumps could reduce injuries by limiting equivalent
   fall heights (EFHs), which indicate dissipated landing impact energy. No
   evidence refutes making terrain park jumps safer in this way. We discuss
   case studies illustrating that large EFHs are significant factors in
   traumatic injuries on terrain park jumps. Standards and design tools for
   builders can make jumps safer. We introduce a tool that can evaluate
   existing jumps as well as design jump profiles with safer equivalent EFHs to
   reduce injuries.

In the paper, we attempt to strengthen the arguments for adopting jump design
standards for public use snow sports jumps. We show how bad jumps can be
through two case studies that resulted in two individuals being paralyzed. We
then highlight the large amount of epidemiological studies that continue to
show the high dangers associated with these jumps and point out that the
scientific literature is also polluted with studies that attempt to cloud the
reality of the dangers; favoring ski industry and insurance companies desires.
Lastly, we discuss the latest release of our software, skijumpdesign_, which
has new features that let jump builders analyze existing or planned jumps by
equivalent fall height calculations. These features were used to analyse the
two case studies in the paper.
