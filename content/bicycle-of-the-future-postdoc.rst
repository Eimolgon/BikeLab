   Steer Assist Bicycle: an example bicycle technology developed at the TU
   Delft Bicycle lab with Gazelle.

Job description
===============

The TU Delft Bicycle Lab is seeking a postdoctoral researcher for a 10 month
full time contract [1]_ with a starting date before the end of 2021. The
researcher will develop and execute an engineering research project for the
"Bicycle of the Future" grant which is supported by ClickNL
(https://www.clicknl.nl) and Royal Dutch Gazelle
(https://www.gazellebikes.com). The aim of the TU Delft and Gazelle
collaboration is to arrive at design solutions that make the bicycle both safer
and more employable in society.

You will work on a project co-developed with the bicycle lab and Royal Dutch
Gazelle that fits into one or more of these three topics:

Bicycle safety solutions
------------------------

Making the bicycle safer from design changes, braking and traction control, and
tailoring the design and assistance to the skills of the rider. Solutions that
prolong and increase bicycling by the elderly are of particular interest.

Smart mobility solutions
------------------------

Cloud connected electric bicycles open the opportunity to use data collected
from a variety of sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes, GNSS receiver, torque
load cells, etc.) to improve transportation safety, efficiency,
personalization, and many other aspects. This topic should use this technology
to bring computer intelligence to bicycle transportation with a focus on the
vehicle’s use of this information.

Advanced transport solutions
----------------------------

Electric bicycles are being widely used to transport goods within urban
environments. This topic should develop and showcase new technology to the
design of electric cargo bicycles to improve the logistics and supply chain in
urban cargo delivery.

Development of proof-of-concept prototype vehicles and vehicle technologies is
a desired outcome of the proposed research projects.

You will work at TU Delft in the 3ME Faculty, mostly in the TU Delft Bicycle
Laboratory. You will work closely with and be mentored by Jason K. Moore and
Arend L. Schwab. You will also work with and collaborate with Gazelle
employees. Lastly, you will work with BSc, MSc, and PhD candidates of the lab.

Opportunities for growing your academic career will be available, such as
mentoring BSc/Students and PhD candidates, conference presentation, networking,
and grant writing.

Requirements
============

You have a PhD degree in engineering in mechanical or biomechanical or related
discipline by the start date of the position. If a related discipline please
justify in your cover letter. Excellent command of the English language is
required, as well as excellent communication skills.
