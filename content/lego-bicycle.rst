`Joep Mutsaerts
<mailto:J.T.M.Mutsaerts@student.tudelft.nl?subject=NXTbike-GS>`__ builds a LEGO
Mindstorms NXT based bicycle robot in an assignment for the TUDelft 3mE/PME
course Mechatronic System Design II. The lateral stability control is done by
the concept of "steer into the undesired fall" and comes down to only one line
of code in the controller: SteerMotorVoltage=8*RearFrameLeanRate.
