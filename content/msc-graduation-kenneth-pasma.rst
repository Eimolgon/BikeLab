Kenneth Pasma successfully defended "`Model Matching Control Applied to
Bicycles
<http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:e0f4dafe-ff81-40af-9466-e8eaa4199a7a>`_" on
August 28, 2024. Kenneth developed a controller for our steer-by-wire bicycle's
steering motor that enables matching the bicycle's dynamics to that of a
reference bicycle. A model matching controller strives to make the input-output
dynamics of the controlled vehicle the same as a reference or target vehicle
(or vehicle design). In essence, this means that we can make a steer
motor-controlled bicycle feel and move as if were another bike, for example one
with a different trail, or different wheel base, or with less mass. Kenneth
applied the approach of applying both feedforward and feedback control to the
steering motor based on force and motion measurements from sensors on the bike.
Once the controller was functioning, he performed two experiments to prove
whether his controller was working as expected: 1) identification of the weave
mode from a lateral pulsive perturbation and 2) identification of steer torque
to steer and roll kinematic transfer functions through sinusoidal forcing of
steer torque.  Kenneth's results show that the controller shifts the weave
mode's decay and frequency behavior towards that of the reference bicycle and
that the input-output magnitude relationships at different forced frequencies
also shift toward that expected of the reference bicycle. Kenneth explained how
these techniques could be used for virtually testing different bicycle designs
and how it can open possibilities for new experiments in bicycle handling and
control. We also hope to use the technology to make our balance assist
bicycle's feel more natural to the rider while retaining the stability effects.

Kenneth was co-supervised by Prof. Thomas Kavicsky (TU Delft) and Jason K.
Moore (TU Delft). Everyone at the bicycle lab is very proud of Kenneth and
wishes him the best in his next adventures.
